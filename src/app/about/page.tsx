        I&apos;m a Front-End Developer with nearly 2 years of experience in
        Front-End Web Development. I specialize in React.js, enjoy solving UI/UX
        challenges, and building scalable products. I am proactive in learning
        and applying modern technologies and best practices to become a better
        engineer. I have recently expanded my skill set to include tools and
        technologies for DevOps and backend integration such as GitHub Actions,
        Docker, Redis, and more.
        <p>
          Iâ€™m highly self-motivated and spend significant time each day learning
          and experimenting with new technologies to improve my skills and stay
          up to date with industry best practices.
